# Faceit Exts

Faceit Exts inspried from Faceit Enhancer. @timche\_ haven't maintained it for a long time. So have many bugs, and features that need to fix/add.
I tried to fix it temporarily but so hard to push the extension files to everyone so I tried to code a new extension and publish it to the chrome store and Firefox Addon to make u guys be able to update the extension directly.

## TechStack

- Manifest V3
- Material UI
- React v17
- Webpack 4.x
- TypeScript

## Features

- Show level process
- Show Elo Estimation for cometitive matchs
- Show Elo change in match history (stats)
- Show Ban history
- Auto accept invite
- Auto Close modal when match end

Please open up an issue to nudge me to update extension.
